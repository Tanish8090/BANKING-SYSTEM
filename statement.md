# **Project Statement**

## **Problem Statement**

This project aims to create a simple command-line banking system that allows users to create an account, log in, and perform basic financial operations. The system currently lacks persistent storage, security measures, and scalability, but provides a functional demonstration of core banking actions such as depositing, withdrawing, and checking balances.
